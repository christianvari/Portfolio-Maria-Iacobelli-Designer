**Empathetic, dreamer and sensitive, I love to understand people's minds and establish sincere human relationships, I love everything that is beauty and art, in whatever form.**
<br/><br/><br/>
After my bachelor's degree in Communication at the Sapienza University of Rome, I decided to continue my studies with a master in Graphic Design and I took the Adobe Professional Certification in Photoshop 2021. 
I began to work as a freelance for some companies, but I felt I was missing something, it wasn't enough for me to draw anymore, I wanted to understand the reality of things, talking to people and help them. 
So, I found out the user experience, I attended the UX Design Institute in Dublin to specialize in this field, and thatâ€™s the story of how Figma became my best friend!
